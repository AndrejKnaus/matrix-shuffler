# Matrix Shuffler

A web application for matrix reordering.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- pnpm (if you don't have it, install it using one of these methods):

### Installing pnpm

**Using npm (recommended):**
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

**Using Homebrew (macOS):**
```bash
brew install pnpm
```

**Using Linux (using npm):**
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

## Getting Started

Clone the repository
Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

## Development

Start the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Building for Production

Create a production build:
```bash
pnpm build
```

## IDE Setup

We recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) extension. Make sure to disable Vetur if you have it installed.

## TypeScript Support

This project uses TypeScript with Vue. For proper type checking:
- We use `vue-tsc` instead of `tsc` for type checking
- The Volar extension provides TypeScript support for `.vue` files

## Configuration

For customizing the build configuration, see the [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).
